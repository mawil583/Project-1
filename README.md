# Project-1
First Group Project!

This website allows users to search for Eventful's most popular events in a city of their choosing. What sets this website apart from most event websites is that a table will populate with the event info PLUS event weather information at the EXACT TIME that the event starts! So if you're sensitive about the weather, you can search for events on our website to see if it's too rainy/snowy/hot/cold for your liking so that you can decided on an event according to your OWN weather preference! 

The technologies used in this project were CSS3, HTML5, Moment.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, Algolia Places Library (autofill), Darksky API, Eventful API, and OpenCage API.
